# Distance-Calibrated License Plate (DCLP) Dataset
**DCLP** is a high-resolution, distance-calibrated dataset designed for vehicle license plate detection and recognition in complex urban environments. 

> **Note:** This repository currently contains **sample data (10 images)** .

### **Introduction**

Different from general traffic datasets, **DCLP** emphasizes quantitative analysis based on spatial distance. Images were captured with distance markers placed every 20 meters, allowing researchers to evaluate algorithm performance at specific distances (0-80m).

 **Key Features**

**Scale:** Full dataset includes 2,500+ images with over 12,000 valid license plates.

**Distance Calibration:** Markers every 20m, effective range 0-80m.

**Resolution:**   5760 × 3840,3840 × 2560,2880 × 1920

 **Complex Environments:** 
     Weather: Sunny (Morning, Afternoon, Evening), Cloudy.
     Traffic: Multiple vehicles per image, high density.

**Capture Setup:** Shot from a gantry 6.5m above urban main roads.

 **Formats:** Available in `JPG` and `RAW` (rich information for image processing).
