# Distance-Calibrated License Plate (DCLP) Dataset
**DCLP** is a high-resolution, distance-calibrated dataset designed for vehicle license plate detection and recognition in complex urban environments. 

### **Introduction**

Different from general traffic datasets, **DCLP** emphasizes quantitative analysis based on spatial distance. Images were captured with distance markers placed every 20 meters, allowing researchers to evaluate algorithm performance at specific distances (0-80m).
